# ==============================================================================
# Salt Master Configuration for Forensics Collection
# Copy this file to /etc/salt/master.d/forensics.conf
#
# This configuration enables:
#   - File receive (cp.push) for artifact collection
#   - Increased timeout for long-running forensic jobs
#   - Custom module/runner paths
# ==============================================================================

# Enable file receive from minions (required for cp.push)
file_recv: True

# Maximum file size for cp.push (MB)
file_recv_max_size: 500

# Directory for pushed files (defaults to /var/cache/salt/master/minions)
# Files will be at: /var/cache/salt/master/minions/<minion-id>/files/...
# file_recv_root: /var/cache/salt/master/minions

# Increase default timeout for forensics jobs
# Default is 5 seconds, forensics needs more time
timeout: 300

# Job cache timeout (keep job results longer)
keep_jobs: 24

# Add custom runners path if using the forensics runner
# Uncomment and adjust path as needed:
# runner_dirs:
#   - /srv/salt/_runners

# Artifact storage location (custom setting for forensics runner)
forensics_artifact_dir: /srv/forensics/artifacts

# Create the artifact directory if it doesn't exist
# Run: mkdir -p /srv/forensics/artifacts && chmod 700 /srv/forensics/artifacts
